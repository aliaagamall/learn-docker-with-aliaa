# Lesson 1: Introduction to Docker and the Problem It Solves


## The Problem: Inconsistent Environments

While working on a Flask web application using Python with dependencies like `flask` and `pandas`, I encountered issues when trying to:

- Run the application on a different laptop.
- Share it with a teammate.
- Deploy it to a cloud server.

The problems included:

- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`.
- Incompatible Python versions.
- Missing or mismatched library versions.
- The "it works on my machine" issue.

To make the application portable, I needed to share:

- The exact Python version.
- A list of installed libraries and their versions.
- Instructions for starting the application.
- The directory structure.

This process was error-prone and time-consuming due to varying environment configurations.

## The Solution: Docker

Docker solves these issues by packaging an application, its dependencies, and its environment into a **container**. A container is a lightweight, portable, and self-contained unit that runs consistently across different systems, such as a local laptop, a teammate's Mac, or a cloud server.

## Analogy

A Docker container is like a self-contained "mini-computer" within your computer. It includes all necessary components—code, libraries, and configuration—and behaves identically regardless of the host environment.

## Next Steps

The next lesson will introduce basic Docker commands and demonstrate their use with a simple Python Flask application.

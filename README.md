# Learn Docker with Aliaa ðŸ˜‹

## Overview

I am currently learning Docker and using this repository, `learn-docker-with-aliaa`, to record my notes in an easy and organized manner. This repo serves as a personal learning journal where I document my progress step by step.

## Purpose

- To track my Docker learning journey.
- To store notes and examples in a simple format.
- To add one lesson at a time as I progress.

## Repository Structure

The repository will contain lesson files added incrementally:
- Each lesson will be saved in a separate Markdown file (e.g., `lesson-1-introduction.md`, `lesson-2-basic-commands.md`).
- Lessons will be updated one by one as I learn new concepts.

## Getting Started

To follow my journey or contribute:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://aliaagamall/learn-docker-with-aliaa.git
   ```
2. Explore the lesson files in the root directory.
